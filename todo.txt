Explore John Muir’s Yosemite

To-Do List

Audio:

A. Audio needs to be pre-loaded before playback begins. Create “loading” animation for opening page (which turns from “loading” to “begin”). In this order:
1. Load all audio files
2. Change opening text from “loading” to “begin”
3. Begin (muted) audio playback

B. Also, is there a cleaner way to loop the audio? Maybe have cross fade between loops to avoid clicks?

C. Create global "volume" control

Content:

A. Need to write historical/contextualizing text for all scenes; begin with Yosemite Valley and Introduction text

B. Mock-up another full scene with a different format (captions, more text, etc)

C. Write credits / about page

Navigation:

A. Figure out “map” drop down screen---plan how it's going to work, create illustrations, implement with animated visuals/audio
